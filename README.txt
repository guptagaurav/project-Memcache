1. To see the webpage goto http://artickly.com/simpleop.

2. Since Artickly is hosted on ipage and it doesn't support Memcache (Currently supported BY google App Engine, AWS, Heroku).\

3. But Memcache is running perfectly in Linux Environment.

4. Therefore right now trying to deploy the app with memcache enabled on Heroku. And simultaneously trying to 
migrate from MySQL to Postgres on Heroku.

5. Included a repositry which includes files without memcache use, under 'without-memcache.git'.
