1. To see the webpage goto http://artickly.com/simpleop.

2. Since Artickly is hosted on ipage and it doesn't support Memcache (Currently supported BY google App Engine, AWS, Heroku).

3. Therefore right now trying to deploy the app with memcache enabled on Heroku. And simultaneously trying to

4. Included a repositry to that includes files without memcache use, under 'without-memcache.git'.
